## Instructions
In this lab we will try to work with API's in react. The main idea of this lab is to fetch details from external API, process it and display it. We have 4 components. One parent component `HomeComponent` and 3 child components 
- OverallComponent
- SearchComponent
- StateComponent

The main theme behind the lab is to fetch book details and display it for reading. They can like it or dislike it after they have read it. So let's start building it.
```API DETAILS
